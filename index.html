      <h1>Lets Explore The Campus of The Woodford Reserve Bourbon Distillery!</h1>
      <h2>      
           The Woodford Reserve Bourbon Distillery was created in 1812 in Woodford County Kentucky. Before it became known as the
        Woodford Reserve Distillery, it was formely known as the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery and later the Labrot & Graham
        Distillery. It is about eight miles from the town of Versailles in north-central Kentucky, off U.S. Route 60 between
        Interstate 64 and Versailles. What's unique about this distillery is that it is very small distillery, yet produces one
        of the highest rated bourbons in the world and is now the main sponsor of the Kentucky Derby!
        The goal of this project is to create a few different maps to better understand the vegetaion of the campus, along with
        the topography of the area, and the campus's potential for solar PV installation!

        The maps I have created for this project serve as a more detailed look at the Woodford Reserve Bourbon Distillery
        campus. The first map shows the topography of the campus by showing 10ft contour lines. The second map shows a more
        detailed look at the vegetation present on the Woodford Reserve campus. The last map is a solar irradiation map that shows the potential for solar PV
        installation througout the campus. The areas on the buildings that are shown in a brighter yellow/orangish color are the
        areas that have the highest intensity of solar irradiation with the least amount of coverage from shading. Hope you
        enjoy my work!

    <p>This map shows the vegetation of the distillery campus. The areas in the lighter color green are grassy areas or open
        fields, the darker green areas are trees or areas of dense vegetation, and the lighter tan colored areas are
        buildings or roadways.</p>
